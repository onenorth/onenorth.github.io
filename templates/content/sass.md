# Sass Manifesto
The Kickstart baseline Sass structure and styles try to adhere to a limited set of general guidelines. These guidelines can be described as a manifesto for developer-friendly Sass:

- [x] Understandable
- [x] Clean
- [x] Adaptable
- [x] Re-usable
- [x] Efficient

These UCARE ideas are perhaps best expressed in the recent [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com "A List Apart website") article [*A vision for our Sass*](http://alistapart.com/article/a-vision-for-our-sass#section4 "A List Apart - A Vision for our Sass"), in which [Felicity Evans](http://alistapart.com/author/fevans "Felicity Evans author bio") presents the following rules:

* **Output** over input
* **Proximity** over abstraction
* **Understanding** over brevity
* **Consolidation** over repetition
* **Function** over presentation
* **Consistency** over novelty

> Not every guideline applies to every situation. Use critical thinking to decide which guidelines are appropriate for your project.
